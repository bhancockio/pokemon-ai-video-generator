## Scene Notes

### Key Visual Moments
1. **Scene 06:** Marcus literally standing at the crossroads—visual metaphor of his paralysis
2. **Scene 17:** Split-screen competing visions (handcuffs vs. wedding rings)—the bridge's internal war visualized
3. **Scene 18:** The text message "I'm done. I'm coming home"—THE decisive turning point
4. **Scene 21:** The embrace with Nia crying into his hoodie—the earned emotional payoff
5. **Scene 22:** View from outside showing warm apartment vs. cold street—visual resolution of the choice

### Environmental Transitions
- **Scenes 1-8:** Dominated by cold blue street environments (car, street corners, trap house)
- **Scenes 9-15:** Split between cold streets (Marcus) and warm home (Nia)—visual separation
- **Scenes 16-17:** Abstract/internal space (competing visions)
- **Scenes 18-22:** Transition from cold to warm as Marcus chooses and returns home

### Character Arc Through Scenes
- **Marcus:** Paralyzed (1-8) → Conflicted (9-15) → Maximum tension (16-17) → Decision (18) → Action (19) → Reunion (20-22)
- **Nia:** Anxious waiting (4-5, 9, 15) → Nostalgic memory (11-12) → Relief and release (20-22)
- **Visual arc:** Cold blue dominates → Split cold/warm → Warm dominates (mirrors Marcus's choice)

### Timing Considerations
- Faster cuts during Hook sections (4-8 seconds) to match emotional intensity
- Longer scenes during verses (8-12 seconds) for storytelling
- Bridge scenes (16-17) use rapid visual changes to show internal chaos
- Final embrace (21) is longest scene (16 seconds) to allow emotional resolution to breathe
- Scene 18 (the text message) is critical sync point—must align perfectly with lyric "So I text you..."
