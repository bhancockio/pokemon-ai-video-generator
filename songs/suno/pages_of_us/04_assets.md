## GLOBAL VISUAL ATMOSPHERE BLOCK

Contemporary urban noir set during a single cold winter night (10 PM to 4 AM), creating stark visual contrast between two worlds: the streets rendered in harsh cold blue streetlights with deep shadows, neon signs casting cyan and magenta glows, visible breath in freezing air, steam rising from manholes creating atmospheric haze, wet asphalt reflecting fragmented light like broken mirrors; versus domestic spaces bathed in warm amber and soft golden tones, intimate tungsten lighting creating safe havens of warmth, soft fabric textures and lived-in comfort. Handheld camera aesthetic for street scenes suggesting tension and instability, locked-off stable framing for home scenes suggesting safety and intimacy. Color temperature progression from cold (2800K blue) to warm (3200K amber) as protagonist moves toward his choice. Textures emphasize urban grit (concrete, metal, glass), fabric softness (hoodies, bedding), and the contrast between hard streets and soft domesticity. Cinematic realism inspired by *Moonlight* meets *City of God*—raw, authentic, emotionally vulnerable, not glamorizing street life but showing its psychological cost. Shallow depth of field isolating characters in their emotional states, atmospheric lighting creating mood over clarity, intimate framing emphasizing internal conflict and human connection over spectacle.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Multi-Character Scene Requirements

**When generating scenes with MULTIPLE characters appearing together:**

You MUST use **ALL relevant character core assets as references** (not just one). This ensures both/all characters maintain their consistent appearances.

**Example:**
- ❌ **WRONG:** Generating Marcus & Nia embrace using only Marcus core → Nia will look different
- ✅ **CORRECT:** Generating Marcus & Nia embrace using BOTH Marcus AND Nia cores → Both characters consistent

**How to identify multi-character scenes:**
- Look for scenes with "embrace", "together", "both", "with [character name]"
- Check the scene breakdown - if multiple characters are listed, use multiple references
- Flashback scenes often show both characters together

**In this manifest:**
- Scenes marked with "⚠️ REQUIRES DUAL REFERENCES" need both character cores
- Use `--reference-image` flag multiple times in the generation command
- Example: `--reference-image core1.png --reference-image core2.png`

These will be generated FIRST in Phase 3 for user review before proceeding to variations.

The street is lit by cold blue streetlights and cyan/magenta neon signs from buildings. Steam rises from manholes creating atmospheric haze. The wet asphalt reflects the lights and taillights. The scene suggests departure, leaving, a choice being made through action. The car is moving away from a trap house or street corner (visible in background with blue neon). The atmosphere is cold but with a sense of movement and decision—no longer paralyzed, now in motion. The red taillights provide a warm accent against the cold blue environment. Steam and mist create atmospheric depth. The scene suggests leaving the streets behind. Car visible but no characters clearly visible inside. Background plate suitable for 1920x1080 16:9 composition, wide shot showing the departure.
```

**Notes:**
- Used in scene 19
- Shows the physical act of leaving the streets
- Movement and decision visualized

### Environment: Apartment Flashback (Torn Couch)

**Suggested filename:** `env_apartment_flashback.png`

**MASTER PROMPT:**
```
Contemporary urban setting with warm nostalgic lighting, slightly desaturated to suggest memory, soft golden glow, intimate domestic space, dreamlike memory quality, cinematic realism.

Interior view of a modest apartment showing a worn couch with a visible tear in the fabric (reference to lyrics "where the couch had a tear but your laugh filled the room"). The space is simple and humble—minimal furniture, suggesting an earlier time when they had less materially but more emotionally. Warm golden nostalgic lighting creates a soft glow throughout the space, but the image is slightly desaturated or has a subtle warm filter to suggest this is a memory, not present time. The atmosphere is warm, intimate, and happy—this is the space of authentic connection before the streets. Soft fabric textures on the torn couch. Simple apartment elements suggesting a real but humble home. The lighting and slight desaturation create a dreamlike memory quality. The scene suggests simpler times, genuine happiness, the past. No characters present. Background plate suitable for 1920x1080 16:9 composition, medium shot showing the couch and surrounding space for character placement.
```

**Notes:**
- Used in scenes 11, 12
- Flashback environment showing happier past
- Nostalgic, slightly desaturated to indicate memory
